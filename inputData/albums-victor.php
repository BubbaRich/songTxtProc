Shut up and turn off the light
<br>I'll take you deep right through the night
<br>Just leave before you're in my sight
<br>'Cause I don't need another fight
<br>And I don't need your sympathy
<br>You'll get no tender love from me
<br>Kneel before me on your knee
<br>Do it hard- make me free
<br>Do it hard- make me free
<br>Do it- make me free
<br>Do it hard- make me free
<br>
<br>Don't want your pity
<br>Don't want your care
<br>Don't care for giving
<br>Don't care for fair
<br>Don't want your kindness
<br>Don't want your heart
<br>Don't care for wanting
<br>Don't care for smart
<br>
<br>I'll come to you from behind
<br>You know my touch will not be kind
<br>You'll feel my loveless power bind
<br>No feelings here that you can find
<br>Between your legs I will lay
<br>On your back you better stay
<br>I'm gonna fuck you night and day
<br>Do it hard- make me pay
<br>Do it hard- make me pay
<br>Do it hard- make me pay
<br>Do it hard- make me pay
<br>Do it hard
<br>
<br>Don't want your pity
<br>Don't want your care
<br>Don't care for giving
<br>Don't care for fair
<br>Don't want your kindness
<br>Don't want your heart
<br>Don't care for wanting
<br>Don't care for smart
<br>
<br>I don't need your sympathy
<br>You'll get no tender love from me
<br>Just kneel before me on your knee
<br>Do it hard- make me free
<br>Do it hard- make me free
<br>Do it hard- please make me free

One more glass
<br>A million more days
<br>One more smoke
<br>Release me from my ways
<br>
<br>Break the mold
<br>Break your back
<br>Break the promise you made
<br>Seek the world now
<br>Don't look back
<br>Make your promise today
<br>Leave the safety
<br>Leave this life
<br>Leave before it's too late
<br>It's your only chance
<br>Don't pretend romance
<br>Keep the new promise you made
<br>
<br>What if I wasn't so scared?
<br>Why can't I be brave?
<br>I've forgotten all that we've shared
<br>You can't give me what I crave
<br>
<br>One more glass
<br>Take another pill
<br>One more day
<br>I feel like I could kill
<br>
<br>What if you let me walk away?
<br>You think it's me who needs to be saved
<br>Your life a tragic, self-centered play
<br>You never gave me what I craved
<br>
<br>What I want
<br>You can never give
<br>What you want
<br>My dead life to live
<br>
<br>Break the mold
<br>Break your back
<br>Break the promise you made
<br>Seek the world now
<br>Don't look back
<br>Make your promise today
<br>Leave the safety
<br>Leave this life
<br>Leave before it's too late
<br>It's your only chance
<br>Don't pretend romance
<br>Keep the new promise you made
<br>
<br>Break the mold
<br>Break your back
<br>Break the promise you made
<br>Leave the safety
<br>Leave this life
<br>Leave before it's too late
<br>Seek the world now
<br>Don't look back
<br>Make your promise today
<br>
<br>KEEP THE PROMISE YOU MADE
<br>KEEP THE PROMISE YOU MADE

I need you to hold me tightly in your arms
<br>I need you to show me if I might be wrong
<br>I am pink and you are blue
<br>Can I trust my whole life to you?
<br>Just don't take me for a fool
<br>When I need to depend on you
<br>I am not your part-time job
<br>What you get is what you are
<br>
<br>You can hurt like no one can
<br>You're such a child for such a man
<br>You need strength, you need to take a stand
<br>Just stop looking to me for a helping hand
<br>When you?re ready I will be here
<br>I can help you lose your fear
<br>You better stand up on your feet
<br>If you ever want to feel my heat
<br>
<br>Clear your mind of those things gone by
<br>You can't change the past, why even try
<br>You can build upon all you've learned
<br>You can start today
<br>
<br>No one said it wouldn't be this hard
<br>When you share, prepare to give a lot
<br>Just remember when you look at me
<br>You are you and I am me
<br>When you're ready I will be here
<br>I can help you lose your fear
<br>You better stand up on your feet
<br>If you ever want to feel my heat
<br>
<br>Clear your mind of those things gone by
<br>You can't change the past, why even try
<br>Look ahead to those better days
<br>Make the effort, it always pays
<br>We can build upon all we've learned
<br>We can start today

He opens the books-looks at the scenes from yesterday
<br>How they laughed and loved and lived before they grew old and grey
<br>Now he sits alone in his room, and the clock ticks away
<br>
<br>Together they enjoyed all life's beauty and all its fears
<br>The lonely cry of his soul falls only on his ears
<br>Each page's photo marked with the stain of his tears
<br>
<br>He didn't know what to do
<br>He didn't know what might come
<br>Nothing was all that was left to him
<br>Nothing was left when she was gone
<br>
<br>The heart has a memory so strong
<br>It remembers every right and every wrong
<br>On those pages of his long, lonely life
<br>He can only see his wife
<br>He said 'Pluck out my eyes'
<br>He said 'Plug up my ears'
<br>He said 'Silence my tongue'
<br>He said 'Take away my empty years'
<br>
<br>One last wish
<br>To see her face
<br>One last breath
<br>He's calling out to death
<br>One last look up at the sun
<br>As he picks up the gun
<br>As he steadies the gun
<br>As he finally aims the gun

<br><hr class="style14"><br><a name=TR6><font size=5 face="Victor" color=maroon>Sending Out A Warning</font><br></a>
Tender is the nerve that leads straight to his heart
<br>Sender sends the spit that streams down his face
<br>Want and need are just two useless words
<br>The third, if she knew it, would be grace
<br>Her grip is tight as a vice-smothers like a killer, stealing
<br>someone's life
<br>His guilt controls his every move-nothing seems to work, what's
<br>he got to prove
<br>Their war was just like any war-all the pain for nothing, double
<br>bladed sword
<br>
<br>Sending out a warning
<br>Sending out a warning
<br>He's on the edge, everything is up or down
<br>She's in his face, he feels like he may drown
<br>Relentless is the scope of her revenge
<br>She'll give then take then push him off the ledge
<br>

<br>She's gone too far, he knows her subtle tricks
<br>He's tried to hard, there are some things you can't fix
<br>Cross too many lines, be prepared to pay the price
<br>All the warmth you knew will forever turn to ice
<br>
<br>Sending out a warning
<br>Sending out a warning

Words: Charlene and Esther
<br>
<br>I don't ask for much, I really don't. I just want him to put the seat down
<br>
<br>What are you talking about 'you don't ask for much'? You ask for everything!
<br>
<br>Well, I just want him to put the seat down when he goes to the bathroom at night.
<br>I go in there and I sit down and it's cold and wet and there's more hair on his feet then on his head!
<br>
<br>No, I like the hairs on the floor!
<br>
<br>What are they doing?
<br>
<br>Oh, there's a shag carpet everyday and this above the toilet. What are they so tall that they have to lean over? Is it that heavy?
<br>
<br>It's so heavy
<br>
<br>Oh my god their only good for one thing and we know what that is...
<br>
<br>What is that?
<br>
<br>Don't tell me
<br>
<br>I keep forgetting
<br>
<br>Just play the guitar
<br>
<br>
<br>He's still talking to me about that vacation we took, he still wants the details.
<br>
<br>Come on!
<br>
<br>Like, I can't take it anymore. What am I suppose to do?
<br>
<br>Did you throw away the pictures?
<br>
<br>Oh, those pictures! If he saw those pictures, he'd have a heart attack!
<br>
<br>Those guys were gorgeous
<br>
<br>Oh were they ever, but he wants to know, 'where did you go, did you go to a bar, did you dance close, did you dance far?'
<br>
<br>I know, 'what were you wearing?'
<br>
<br>Oh my god, 'were they looking at you. who danced with you, did they come home with you? who drove you home? Were they younger then me, older then me, did they treat you better then me?'
<br>
<br>But you know what?
<br>
<br>Oh god it was awful!
<br>
<br>I always tell him, 'honey, just shut up and play the guitar!'
<br>
<br>
<br>Has he asked you to play a hooker?
<br>
<br>Ah... I can't believe you're saying that, he does that to me all the time! All the time
<br>
<br>They're all the same, it's sickening! Hookers, lipstick, big hair, makeup, the sluty outfits, mascara, false eye-lashes. The thing with the false eye-lashes! Does he want you to shave?
<br>
<br>The whole thing, everything, dye things
<br>
<br>Oh my, their all the same, I'm so sick of it. We're different, women are so different
<br>
<br>The only thing is, we wouldn't get paid for it
<br>
<br>Oh god, well, they pay for it okay
<br>
<br>In the long run?
<br>Oh, in the short run because they just have to play the guitar!
<br>
<br>
<br>Do you find that he always want's attention, it's (constantly) always him him him him him ?
<br>
<br>Constant attention
<br>
<br>I can't take it, he comes home, and he wants me to caress him and tell him how great he is and this and this
<br>
<br>Shut Up!
<br>
<br>I love you, I love you, you're the best, there is no one else
<br>
<br>Like really, how many time am I suppose to tell him that? All I want to do is relax, have a nice little drink
<br>
<br>Shut Up!
<br>
<br>Give him a little hug, but it always leads to something else
<br>
<br>Yea, you can't just hug, you have to go on and on and then the comes out
<br>
<br>It always turns sexual
<br>
<br>Just Shut Up!
<br>
<br>unbelievable it just goes on and on and on
<br>
<br>Just Shut Up Shuttin' Up!
<br>
<br>Their only good for one thing, just play the guitar!
<br>
<br>SHUT UP! AH, JUST SHUT UP! MAN! SHUT UP SHUTTIN' UP! SHUT UP, SHUT, SHUT, SHUT IT, SHUT IT ALL UP. SHUT UP... SHUTTIN' UP!

I've seen so many places, and always left my mark
<br>I've kissed so many faces, lips smooth, just like a shark
<br>I have no friends, I hope that's understood
<br>I take what I can take, when the taking's good
<br>It's not for love, but I'll gladly take your money
<br>I can pretend to be so sad or funny
<br>You'll just love the way I move when I dance
<br>My young hips, they know how to entrance
<br>Nevermind him, he's not here now
<br>It's really not my problem, anyhow
<br>
<br>An angel of love to you is what I'll appear
<br>Your lonely ache, I can make, disappear
<br>Yes, take me deep inside so I can heal your pain
<br>No angel of love takes another man's gain
<br>
<br>You want to keep me held inside your cage
<br>You best remember, you're twice my age
<br>You think I'll want you with me for evermore
<br>It's only been two weeks, and you're such a bore
<br>I can see you're new to this, you don't know the rules
<br>You're just another one in the long line of fools
<br>Can you be happy for my moment in your life
<br>It doesn't bother you you're someone else's wife
<br>
<br>An angel of love is what I may appear
<br>What I really am is really not so clear
<br>I don't live for love, you sticky bitch
<br>All I care about is if you're rich
<br>You decide if you still want to play this game
<br>The price to you for this is nothing will ever be the same

Victor was a little baby into this world he came
<br>His father took him on his knee and said 'Don't dishonor the family name.'
<br>Victor looked up at his father-looked up with big brown eyes:
<br>His father said; 'Victor my only son, don't you ever tell lies.'
<br>
<br>It was a frosty December, it wasn't the season for fruits
<br>His father fell dead of heart disease while lacing up his boots
<br>It was a frosty December when into his grave he sank;
<br>His uncle found Victor a post as cashier at the Midland Counties Bank.
<br>
<br>It was a frosty December Victor was only eighteen
<br>But his figures were straight and his margins straight and his cuffs were always clean
<br>He took a room at the Peveril, a respectable boarding-house;
<br>And Time watched Victor day after day as a cat will watch a mouse
<br>Victor went up to his bedroom, set the alarm bell
<br>Climbed into bed, took his Bible and read of what happened to Jezebel.
<br>
<br>It was the first of April, Anna to the Peveril came
<br>Her eyes, her lips, her breasts, her hips and her smile set men aflame
<br>It was the second of April she was wearing a coat of fur;
<br>Victor met her upon the stairs and he fell in love with her
<br>
<br>The first time he made his proposal, she laughed, said 'I'll never wed'
<br>The second time there was a pause, then she smiled and shook her head
<br>Anna looked into the mirror, pouted and gave a frown
<br>Said; 'Victor's as dull as a wet afternoon but I've got to settle down.'
<br>The third time he made his proposal, as they walked by the Reservoir
<br>She gave him a kiss like a blow to the head and said, 'You are my heart's desire.'
<br>They were married early in August, she said; 'Kiss me, you funny boy.'
<br>Victor took her in his arms and said: 'Oh my Helen of Troy.'
<br>
<br>The clerks were talking of Anna, the door was just ajar:
<br>One said, 'Poor old Victor, but where ignorance is bliss, etcetera.'
<br>Victor looked up at the sunset as he stood there all alone;
<br>Cried: 'Are you in Heaven, Father?', but the sky said 'Address not known.'
<br>
<br>Victor looked up at the mountains, the mountains all covered with snow:
<br>Cried: 'Are you pleased with me Father?' and the answer came back, No
<br>Victor came to the forest, cried; 'Father, will she ever be true?'
<br>And the oaks and the beeches shook their heads and they answered: 'Not to you.'
<br>Victor came to the meadow where the wind went sweeping by:
<br>Cried: 'O Father, I love her so.' But the wind said: 'She must die.'
<br>Victor cam to the river running so deep and so still:
<br>Crying 'O Father, what shall I do?' and the river answered: 'Kill.'
<br>
<br>Anna was sitting at table, drawing cards from a pack:
<br>Anna was sitting at table waiting for her husband to come back.
<br>Victor stood in the doorway, he didn't utter a word
<br>She said: 'What's the matter, honey?' he behaved like he hadn't heard
<br>There was a voice in his left ear, there was a voice in his right
<br>There was a voice at the base of this skull saying: 'She must die tonight.'
<br>Victor picked up a carving-knife, his features were set and drawn
<br>Said 'Anna, it would have been better for you if you had not been born.'

<br>
<br>Anna jumped up from the table, Anna started to scream
<br>But Victor came slowly after her like a horror in a dream
<br>She dodged behind the sofa, she tore down a curtain rod
<br>But Victor came slowly after her, said 'Prepare to meet thy God.'
<br>
<br>He stood there above the body, he stood there holding the knife
<br>And the blood ran down the stairs and sang: 'I am the Resurrection and the Life.'
<br>They tapped Victor on the shoulder, they took him away in a van:
<br>He sat as quite as a lump of moss saying: 'I am the Son of Man.'
<br>
<br>Victor sat in the corner
<br>Making a woman of clay
<br>Saying: 'I am Alpha and Omega, I shall come to judge the earth one day.'

<br><hr class="style14"><br><a name=TR11><font size=5 face="Victor" color=maroon>I Am The Spirit</font><br></a>
I am the star-filled sky in winter
<br>I am the starry-eyed who stares
<br>I am the cold, grey rock of mountains
<br>I am the one whole climbs those stairs
<br>I am-the sea, so calm yet fearsome
<br>I am-the one to seize the chance
<br>I am-the air so pure yet foul
<br>I am-the one who takes a stance
<br>All you have is what there is
<br>All there is, is what you make
<br>All you make is all there is
<br>All for your own sake
<br>I am the building, tall and handsome
<br>I am the builder, the one who cares
<br>I am the painting on the canvas
<br>I am the painter, the one who shares
<br>I am-the trees, so strong and silent
<br>I am-the earth, all life to give
<br>I am-the sun, both lover and killer
<br>I am-the child, through you, I live
<br>I have a need for building on tomorrow
<br>I have a need to begin today
<br>I have no time for living some past sorrow
<br>I just want to get on my way
<br>I need to have strength in my conviction
<br>I need to have the final say
<br>I need to make sense in my selection
<br>I just want to get on my way
<br>You only have you
<br>I only have me
<br>You lonely with you
<br>Me lonely with me
<br>You can give it to me
<br>I can take it from you
<br>You'll always have it from me
<br>We'll be always
<br>I am the wind, both warm and freezing
<br>I am the truth, not always fair
<br>I am the clouds, static yet fleeting
<br>I am the heart, a burden to bear
<br>I am-the main for all the seasons
<br>I am-the boy who never fears
<br>I am-the woman who knows all the reasons
<br>I am-the girl who sheds the tears
